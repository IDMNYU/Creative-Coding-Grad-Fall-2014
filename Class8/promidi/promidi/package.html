The midi library allows Processing and every other Java Application
to send and receive Midiinformation. 
Mididata can be received and send by installed Midi-Ports.<br>
<br> 
To install unzip the file into your processing libraries folder.<br>
<br>
The intention of that library was to synchronize Processing via Midi 
to music and use it for live visuals. Another possibility is the generation of
Midi Data to make sound for your visuals<br>
<br>
There are a lot of changes in the new proMIDI version so you have a new
plug method, where you can directly plug method that handle the incoming midi
data. You no longer need to take care for sending note offs, instead you
create notes with a length, the notes are buffered and proMIDI automatically
send the note off. Also the opening of in and outputs has changed. You can now
open only a certain channel of a midiport.
<br><br>
The biggest change however is that proMIDI does now include a sequencer and
tracks and patterns to create musical structures. There will follow methods
for recording events and playback midifiles soon.<br><br>
